## SKIN CANCER DETECTION AND DIABETIC RETINOPATHY USING MACHINE LEARNING.
### TESTING THROUGH ANDROID AND WEB APPLICATIONS.
1. FLOW : USER/EXPERT WILL SCAN THE MEDICAL IMAGE OF SKIN OR EYE(RETINA) AND THE LEARNT MACHINE WILL RECOGNIZE IT AND SHOW THE RESULTS WHETHER HE/SHE IS     SUFFERING FROM SKIN CANCER OR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.
2. WHAT'S NEW? : DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IS MAINLY DETECTED ACROSS THE WORLD MANUALLY(LOW ACCURACY,HIGH COST , UNAVAILABILITY,TIME TAKING) BUT HERE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING IT USING MACHINE LEARNING THUS WORKING ON THE PREVIOUS MENTIONED FACTORS AND INCREASING THE ACCURACY.
SKIN CANCER USUALLY DETECTED THROUGH TIME TAKING PROCESS IN HOSPITALS BUT HERE WITH JUST THE CLICK OF IMAGE MACHINE WILL DETECT IF THE USER IS SUFFERING FROM SKIN CANCER OR NOT.

### 2 SEPARATE ANDROID APPLICATIONS ARE MADE: 1. FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY 2. FOR SKIN CANCER DETECTION
